I'm getting hit from all angles, its like the walking dead around here these days. I'm starting to feel like I'm in the Olympics(2016), and I can't win they are better, way way better then me..... eitherway this is being posted with love- ♡ This is nothing I want to be apart of anymore!! I am now reminded of why I walked away (or stood dormant) in the first place... this ain't love anymore 💔 , How could it be? when they start to bite the ✋️ that feeds? Its no longer love, it then becomes work, and work leads to doing something you gotta do.. But if you loved what you do then it could never be work 🤯
